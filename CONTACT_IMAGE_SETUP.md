# Contact Image Setup

## How to Add a Contact Form Illustration

1. **Download a Contact Form Illustration:**
   - Visit: https://iconscout.com/illustrations/contact-form
   - Or: https://scale.flexiple.com/illustrations/forms-multi
   - Download a free contact form illustration in PNG or SVG format

2. **Add the Image:**
   - Save the image as `contact-form.png`
   - Place it in: `src/assets/images/contact/contact-form.png`

3. **Update the Code:**
   - Open `src/parts/Discuss.js`
   - Find the comment section around line 114-126
   - Uncomment the `<img>` tag and remove the placeholder `<div>`

## Alternative: Use a Different Existing Image

If you want to use an existing image from your project, you can:
- Replace the placeholder with any image from `src/assets/images/`
- Just update the import path in `Discuss.js`
