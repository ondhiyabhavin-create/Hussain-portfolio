# Hero Image Setup

## How to Replace Home Page Image with Cloud/Server Image

1. **Download a Cloud/Server Image:**
   - Visit: https://undraw.co (search "server" or "cloud")
   - Or: https://www.flaticon.com (search "cloud server")
   - Or: https://www.freepik.com (search "cloud server illustration")
   - Download a PNG image with transparent background

2. **Save the Image:**
   - Save the image as: `cloud-server.png`
   - Place it in: `src/assets/images/hero/cloud-server.png`

3. **The code is already updated** - once you add the image file, it will automatically be used on the home page.

## Alternative: Use Existing Image Temporarily

If you want to test with an existing image first, you can temporarily rename one of the existing images in `src/assets/images/hero/` to `cloud-server.png`.
